# regex_pulmonary_edema

The regex keyword terms are used for pulmonary edema assessment in the context of congestive heart failure (CHF). <br/>
We recommend that you use regex on radiology reports wrriten during CHF visits, in order to limit confounding from other disease processes. <br/>
CHF diagnosis information for [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) can be found in the submodule of [mimic_cxr_heart_failure](https://github.com/RayRuizhiLiao/mimic_cxr_heart_failure). To add this submodule, run the following line in your git repository:
