# regex_pulmonary_edema

The regex keyword terms are used for pulmonary edema assessment in the context of congestive heart failure (CHF).

We recommend that you use regex on radiology reports written during CHF visits, in order to limit confounding from other disease processes.

CHF diagnosis information for [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) can be found in the submodule of [mimic_cxr_heart_failure](https://github.com/RayRuizhiLiao/mimic_cxr_heart_failure). To add this submodule, run the following line in your git repository:

<code> git submodule update --init --recursive </code>
