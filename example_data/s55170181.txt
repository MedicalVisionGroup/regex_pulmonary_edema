 FINDINGS:   Assessment of the lung apices is somewhat limited by the patient's neck and chin projecting over these areas.  A left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated within the right lung base, along with streaky retrocardiac opacity.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted.  Moderate to severe degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present along with chronic compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body. 

 IMPRESSION:   Limited assessment of the lung apices.  Patchy opacities in the right lung base may reflect infection or aspiration in the correct clinical setting.  Streaky retrocardiac atelectasis.
